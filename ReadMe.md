# Project README: SQuAD 2.0 Model Evaluation

## Overview

This project focuses on evaluating the performance of a BERT-based Question Answering (QA) model using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) 2.0. It aims to benchmark how well the model can comprehend and answer questions derived from a given context, simulating scenarios akin to those encountered in real-life applications such as interview preparation tools, educational aids, and more.

## Objectives

- **Model Evaluation**: To assess the BERT model's accuracy and effectiveness in answering questions correctly by comparing predicted answers against actual answers in the SQuAD 2.0 dataset.
- **Performance Insights**: To analyze the model's performance across different dimensions, such as question types and answer lengths, to identify strengths and areas for improvement.

## Model and Dataset

- **Model**: The project uses a pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face's Transformers library, renowned for its effectiveness in various natural language processing tasks, including question answering.
- **Dataset**: SQuAD 2.0 extends the original SQuAD dataset by including over 50,000 new, unanswerable questions that are designed to look similar to answerable ones. This addition presents a more challenging task for QA models, testing not only their ability to find correct answers but also to discern when no answer is available.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Simplified Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of questions for which the model's predicted answer exactly matches the actual answer. This metric provides a straightforward way to gauge the model's performance.
- **Visualization**: Utilizes Matplotlib to generate graphs illustrating the model's accuracy across various question types and answer lengths, offering visual insights into its performance.

## Challenges

The project addresses several challenges inherent in QA model evaluation, such as processing and interpreting model outputs, handling a mix of answerable and unanswerable questions, and devising meaningful metrics that accurately reflect the model's capabilities in real-world scenarios.

## Future Directions

Potential extensions of this project include integrating more sophisticated evaluation metrics like F1 score and Exact Match, exploring the impact of different model architectures (e.g., RoBERTa, ALBERT) on performance, and enhancing the evaluation framework to include adversarial question answering scenarios.
